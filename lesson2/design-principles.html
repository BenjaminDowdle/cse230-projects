      <p>
        Hick's Law is a law based around decision making. It explains that in
        order to get a faster decision-making process, you must first reduce the
        number of stimuli present. One example that I thought of was the Apple
        website. They have reduced the stimuli on their front page so that it
        has become VERY easy for the user to quickly decide on which one of
        Apple's new products the user would want to look into.
